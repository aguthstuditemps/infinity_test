## Road to 2.0

* Test::Unit/Minitest.
* RubyDefault strategy.
* Make callbacks work in the new structure.
* Work with test pattern on Configuration overwriting the Test framework instance.
* Be possible to rewrite the rules in more nicer way, using the Hike gem to find files and paths.
* Work with gemsets.
* Rails.
* Padrino.
* Rvm.
* Test with spork and zeus and other gems spork like (Experimental).

### 2.0.0 Bugs

* Improve auto discover feature priorization subclasses for #run? method.
* Observer process signal must work in Ruby 2.0.0.

### Flexibility

* Ignore test files and test folders when run command and change files/dir.
* Verbose way of InfinityTest.
* Add specific options to the command.
* Create a infinity test generator with thor!
* Don't run integration tests. Ignore them when changed.

### 2.0.2

* RbEnv (experimented feature).
* Bacon.
* Focus feature(fails, pass one file, run entire suite) with --focus (experimented feature)!
* Cucumber
*

Maybe we could create a infinity-test-contrib repositories with other heuristics platforms
